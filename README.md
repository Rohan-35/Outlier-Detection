In this, I have illustrated 2 most effective methods for detecting outliers in out Dataset. One is Box plot and other is by using a more mathematical approach of IQR (inner quartile range).
Inner quartile Range suggests that if any datapoint lies beyond third quartile, and lies below first quartile, then it is considered Outlier.
I have tried to implement 2 methods of detecting outliers in an dataset i.e. using Box Plot and Inner quartile range.

It is very important to understand various methods of detecting outliers in our dataset to properly conclude on data, hence a important step in data preprocessing.
